McLuster - a tool to make a star cluster

Developed by Andreas H.W. Kuepper at AIfA Bonn, Germany,
in collaboration with Pavel Kroupa & Holger Baumgardt.

25 March 2013

Detailed information on the code and the parameters can 
be found in the following paper:

Kuepper A.H.W., Maschberger T., Kroupa P., Baumgardt H., 2011, MNRAS, 417, 2300
"Mass segregation and fractal substructure in young massive clusters: 
(I) the McLuster code and method calibration"

This reference should be used for any publications that
utilize McLuster.

**************************************************************

INTRODUCTION:

McLuster can be run from the command line by passing arguments
to the code which specify the desired cluster, e.g.,

> mcluster -N1000 -R2.0 -P0

would give a cluster with a Plummer profile and a half-mass
radius of 2 pc, consisting of 1000 stars. For parameters
which are not specified default values are taken, which can be
changed within the code. Go to the top of the 'main' routine
for a complete list of available parameters with descriptions.


By typing 

> mcluster -h 

you get the allowed arguments which can be passed to McLuster
which will be described in detail in the following:


       -N <number> (number of stars)               

The number of stars may vary from 3 to ~10^6. Remember though 
that some procedures within the code require ~N^2 computational 
steps which may take incredibly long. Furthermore, processes
like mass segregation and fractalization may temporarily 
need a lot of memory/or may temporarily generate more stars than
the required number. The parameter NMAX within the main 
routine may have to be set to a higher value then.

                  
       -M <value> (mass of cluster; specify either N or M)           

If you specify the total mass of your cluster then McLuster 
will generate stars until the total mass reaches M. 


       -P <0|1|2|3|-1> (density profile; 0= Plummer, 1= King (1966),    
                   2= Subr et al. (2007) mass-segregated,            
                   3= 2-dimensional EFF/Nuker template,
		   -1= no density gradient)

The density profile is used to generate the positions &
velocities of the stars. The final cluster is then scaled to
exactly match the half-mass radius which you specified. In case
you chose the EFF/Nuker profile McLuster, will integrate the density 
distribution and determine the expected half-mass radius of 
that specific distribution. The final cluster is then scaled
to this expectation value.

For the generation of the Subr et al. profile the routine
PLUMIX is used, whose most recent version was incorporated
in McLuster.

Note that some choices for the profile necessitate further
parameters to be specified.

             
       -W <1-12> (W0 parameter for King model)                       

In case you choose the King profile you"ll have to specify its
concentration which is done by fixing its W0 value.


       -R <value> (half-mass radius [pc], ignored for P = 3)         

The half-mass radius of the cluster has to be specified for all
density profiles except for the EFF/Nuker profile. For the latter it 
gets determined automatically according to your choice of the
scale radius and the cut-off radius. All radii are set in pc!
By setting the half-mass radius to -1, McLuster will use the
cluster mass-half-mass radius relation from Marks & Kroupa (2012)
to estimate an initial half-mass radius according to your choice
of mass. 


       -r <value> (scale radius of EFF/Nuker template [pc])         

This specifies the scale radius, see Elson, Fall & Freeman (1987)
and or Lauer et al. (1995) for Nuker template.


       -c <value> (cut-off radius of EFF/Nuker template [pc])    

Since the EFF and Nuker profiles extend infinitely they have to be 
cut off at some radius.

   
       -g <value> (power-law slope(s) of EFF/Nuker template; use
       	  	    once for EFF template; use three times for Nuker
		    template (outer slope, inner slope, transition)

With this option you can set the power-law slopes of the EFF and Nuker 
profiles. Use once for EFF to set the outer slope. Use three times for 
outer slope, inner slope and the transition parameter. Note that the EFF
profile is a special case of the Nuker profile with the inner slope set
to 0.0 and the transition parameter set to 2.0.

        
       -S <0.0-1.0> (degree of mass segregation; 0.0= no segregation)

Mass segregation can be added to any choice of profile. In case of
the Subr et al. profile the S value should lie between 0.0 and 0.5
in order to produce reasonable clusters (see Subr, Kroupa & Baumgardt
2007 for further details). All other density profiles allow values 
from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 corresponds to total segregation, i.e.
the most massive star sits most deeply within the cluster potential,
followed by the second most massive star, etc. The segregation of 
stars is done following Baumgardt, de Marchi & Kroupa (2008).


       -D <1.6-3.0> (fractal dimension; 3.0= no fractalization)

Any density profile can be fractalized. The fractal dimension
specifies the degree of fractalization. Values of 2.6 are 
reasonable, and values lower than 1.6 should be omitted. The 
fractalization is realized similar as described in Whitworth &
Goodwin (2004). If you choose P = -1 you can get a fractal
distribution of stars without explicit density gradient. 

      
       -T <value> (tcrit in N-body units)                            

This specifies the time after which the N-body calculations
should be stopped. For details see Sverre Aarseth's NbodyX 
handbook.


       -Q <value> (virial ratio)  

The virial ratio can be any positive value. 0.5 means virial 
equlibrium, values >0.5 mean initial expansion, and values
<0.5 result in collapsing clusters.

                                   
       -C <0|1|3|4> (code; 0= Nbody6, 1= Nbody4, 
       	  	     3= table of stars, 4= Nbody7)    

If you want to use the output of McLuster as input for your 
N-body computations you should specify the corresponding code.
You can also generate an ascii table of stars instead.


       -A <value> (dtadj in N-body units)                            

Sets the adjustment time-step for Sverre's NbodyX codes.


       -O <value> (deltat in N-body units)              

Sets the output interval of NbodyX.

             
       -G <0|1> (GPU usage; 0= no GPU, 1= use GPU)

Specify whether you want to use Nbody6 with a GPU.

                   
       -o <name> (output name of cluster model)                      

Change the name of the output file(s).


       -f <0|1|2|3|4> (IMF; 0= no IMF, 1= Kroupa (2001), 
       	  2= user defined, 3= equal to "=1" but with optimal 
	  sampling, 4= L3 IMF from Maschberger 2012)

Set f to 0 for a cluster consisting of single-mass stars. For f
set to 1 the canonical two-part power-law Kroupa IMF is used from
0.08 Msun to 100 Msun. Those default values can be changed within 
the main routine of the code or with the -m option. The first -m
will specify the lower mass limit, the second one will set the 
upper mass limit.
If f is set to 2 you can specify the limiting masses and slopes 
between those limits for up to 10 power-law slopes and 11 mass limits. 
If you need more, change the parameters MAX_AN and MAX_MN within 
main.h accordingly.
If f is set to 4 you can also use the -m option to set upper and
lower mass limits, and you can also use the -a option to specify
the power law slopes and the mu parameter of the L3 IMF. First -a
will set alpha, the second will set beta and the third is for mu.


       -a <value> (IMF slope for user defined IMF, may be used       
                   multiple times, from low mass to high mass; or
		   for parameters alpha, beta and mu of L3 IMF) 
      
       -m <value> (IMF mass limits for the IMF; for user defined IMF 
       	  	  it may be used multiple times; always set limits
		  from low mass to high mass [Msun])

Specify the mass limits and the power-law slopes of the IMF as follows

> mcluster -f2 -m 0.08 -a -1.3 -m 0.5 -a -2.3 -m 150.0

This would yield a Kroupa IMF ranging from 0.08 Msun to 150 Msun.

> mcluster -f4 -m 0.01 -m 100.0 -a 2.3 -a 1.4 -a 0.2

This would give a L3 IMF from 0.01 to 100 Msun with alpha = 2.3,
beta = 1.4 and mu = 0.2.


       -B <number> (number of binary systems)                        

       -b <value> (binary fraction, specify either B or b)           

For the binary content you can specify the fraction of stars
in binaries, 0.0 <= b <= 1.0, or the number of binary systems,
0 <= B <= N/2. Note that the total mass of the cluster may exceed
the mass you specified initially when using high binary fractions 
and eigenevolution. This is due to the form of the eigenevolution
algorithm. Also, do not use eigenevolution when using BSE! 


       -p <0|1|2> (binary pairing, 0= random, 1= ordered for M>5Msun,
                   2= random but separate pairing for M>5Msun)  

If p is 0 then the components of each binary are randomly drawn 
from the stars of the cluster. If p is 1 then first all stars above
5 Msun are put in binaries, where the most massive star is put 
together with the second most massive star, the third with the
forth, and so on until the desired binary fraction/number of 
binaries is reached, or until no more stars above 5 Msun are 
available. In this case the following stars are again drawn 
randomly. The limit between random and ordered sampling can be
set within the main routine by changin the variable 'msort'. In
addition, binaries with primary masses above msort can be chosen
to follow a period distribution as given in Sana & Evans (2011) by
setting the parameter 'OBperiods' in the main routine to 1 (recommended).
If p is set to 2 then stars above 5 Msun are paired randomly among each
other and the rest is also paired randomly.

       -s <number> (seed for randomization; 0= randomize by timer)   

If s is set to 0 then each call of McLuster will generate an
independent realization of the specified cluster parameters (random
number generator is seeded with the local time). Any other integer 
number will result in exactly the same realization (except for rounding
differences).


       -t <1|2|3> (tidal field; 1= near-field, 2= point-mass,        
                   3= Milky-Way potential)                      

The tidal field can be specified according to the NbodyX manual.
By setting the cluster's galactocentric radius and its orbital
velocity, McLuster calculates the theoretical tidal radius and 
cuts off the Plummer profile at this radius (if P is set to 0).

     
       -e <value> (epoch for stellar evolution [Myr])

This parameter can be used to set the cluster age but only with
mcluster_sse. McLuster will use the SSE routines by Hurley et al.
to evolve the cluster stars from their initial masses to the 
masses at the specified age. It also calculates the according
luminosites, stellar radii, etc. If you are interested in a 
cluster of age zero but also need those stellar parameters, then
use mcluster_sse and set e to a small value such as 0.1. Within
the main.c file you can also activate BSE for binary evolution of
primordial binaries. Therefore, set BSE = 1.

                
       -Z <value> (metallicity [0.0001-0.03, 0.02 = solar]) 

Use Z to set the cluster metallicity. Alternatively, you can set
the parameter FeH within the main routine to your desired [Fe/H]
value such that McLuster will calculate the according Z value.

         
       -X <value> (galactocentric radius vector, use 3x, [pc])

Use X three times to specify the position of the cluster within
the galaxy, e.g.,

> mcluster -X 8500 -X 0 -X 0

to set the cluster to a position of x = 8.5 kpc, y = z = 0 kpc.

       
       -V <value> (cluster velocity vector, use 3x, [km/s])          

With V you can specify the cluster's orbital velocity, e.g.,

> mcluster -V 0 -V 220 -V 0

for a cluster orbital velocity of 220 km/s within the x-y-
plane.


       -u <0|1> (output units; 0= Nbody, 1= astrophysical)           

When you generate a table of stars you may be interested in 
astrophysical units rather than Nbody units.
