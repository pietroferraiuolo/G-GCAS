## Installation
Since this package uses a combination of Python (mainly), R, C and Fortran, some additional steps, as
to avoid errors in the code execution, must be done before installing the package.

<ins>NOTE</ins>: The use of a conda environment with `python >= 3.10` is highly recommended for the
correct functioning of the package.

<ins>NOTE2</ins>: All the extra steps necessay will be accounted for in the setup of the package 
itself, sooner or later...

### Build R
Firstly, one must install R, as the `statistics` module of the package uses R code to perform regression routines:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install r-base r-base-dev
```

This will install the latest R distribution, as well as all the base packages that coome with it. The
`dev` install makes sure the appropriate compilers are installed, so that R packages can be correctly
built upon installing them. If compiler errors arise (mentioning `GLIBCXX_3.4.XX not found for librosa`), try installing directly the `gcc` compiler:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gcc
```

### Install latex parser dependencies: ANTLR4
Since the `formulary` module, which handles formulas definitions and computations, use both the sympy
and the latex syntax interpreter, the latter needs an additional package to run: the ANTLR4 python 
routine. As of version `0.2.0` of GRASP, the precise version to install is:

```bash
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime==4.11
```

Equivalently:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge antlr4-python3-runtime==4.11
```

### Installing GRASP
Finally, when everything is set up, install the package through the repository, as no PyPI release
exists yet:

```bash
pip install git+'https://github.com/pietroferraiuolo/GRASP.git'
```

### Retrieving data
Right now, the only implemented archive available for data retrievement is the GAIA archive.
It is comprehensive of various data tables, with the main table for data release `X`
being `gaiadrX.gaia_source`. To list all the available data tables:

```py
> import grasp

> grasp.available_tables() # or equivalentely grasp.gaia.query.available_tables()
"INFO: Retrieving tables... [astroquery.utils.tap.core]"
"INFO: Parsing tables... [astroquery.utils.tap.core]"
"INFO: Done. [astroquery.utils.tap.core]"
"external.apassdr9"
"external.catwise2020"
"external.gaiadr2_astrophysical_parameters"
.
. 
. # continuing with all available data tables
```

As for (gaia) data retrievement, there is the `grasp.gaia.query` module containing the `GaiaQuery`
class, which can be instanced with any of the availble tables, passed as a string. For example, if
one wants to work with GAIA DR2 data, simply:

```py
> dr2 = grasp.GaiaQuery('gaiadr2.gaia_source') # or grasp.gaia.query.GaiaQuery()
"Initialized with Gaia table: 'gaiadr2.gaia_source'"
```

Let's say we want to work with the latest (as of 2025) data release, DR3 (there is a fast alias for 
that):

```py
> dr3 = grasp.dr3()
"Initialized with Gaia table: 'gaiadr3.gaia_source'"
> dr3
"""
GAIADR3.GAIA_SOURCE
-------------------
This table has an entry for every Gaia observed source as published with this data release. 
It contains the basic source parameters, in their final state as processed by the Gaia Data 
Processing and Analysis Consortium from the raw data coming from the spacecraft. The table 
is complemented with others containing information specific to certain kinds of objects 
(e.g.~Solar--system objects, non--single stars, variables etc.) and value--added processing 
(e.g.~astrophysical parameters etc.). Further array data types (spectra, epoch measurements) 
are presented separately via Datalink resources.

<grasp.query.GaiaQuery class>"""
```

For an easy and fast astrometry (or photometry) data retrival, there are built-in functions.
Let's assume we want to retrieve astrometric data of all the sources falling within a circle on the 
sky, with radius $r=1.0\,\deg$ and center coordinates $(\alpha, \delta) = (6.02, -72.08) \deg$,
and we want to save the data obtained:

```py
> a_sample = dr3.get_astrometry(radius=1., ra=6.02, dec=-72.08, save=True)
"Not a Cluster: no model available"
"INFO: Query finished. [astroquery.utils.tap.core]"
"Sample number of sources: 229382"
"Path '.../graspdata/query/UNTRACKEDDATA' did not exist. Created."
".../graspdata/query/UNTRACKEDDATA/20250312_111553/query_data.txt"
".../graspdata/query/UNTRACKEDDATA/20250312_111553/query_info.ini"

parallax - parallax_error - pmra - pmra_error - pmdec -
"""
```

Every query will have a unique tracking numer identifier of the format `YYYYMMDD_hhmmss`. The query
returns a `grasp.Sample` object, which handles all data and cluster integration in one place. Common
`pandas` and `astropy.QTable methods are available`:

Since there is a big focus on globular clusters for the `grasp` package, the same result could be 
achieved by simply passing as arguments of the functions the radius and the GC name.

The center coordinates used in the previous example, are the coordinates for the center of the GC
*NGC 104* (as listed in the Harry's 2010 edition catalogue). So we can repeat the query like this:

```py
> a_sample = dr3.get_astrometry(radius=1., gc='ngc104', save=True)
"INFO: Query finished. [astroquery.utils.tap.core]"
"Sample number of sources: 229490"
"Path '.../graspdata/query/NGC104' did not exist. Created."
".../graspdata/query/NGC104/20250312_112905/query_data.txt"
".../graspdata/query/NGC104/20250312_112905/query_info.ini"

> a_sample
"""

Data Columns:
source_id - ra - ra_error - dec - dec_error - 
parallax - parallax_error - pmra - pmra_error - pmdec - 
pmdec_error
"""
```

With the addition that we have now available useful data on the Cluster (<ins>NOTE</ins>: this is 
non other than an implementation of the `grasp.Cluster` class):

```py
> print(a_sample.gc)
"""

"""
```

All the "fixed" query functions (`.get_astrometry`, `.get_photometry`, `.get_rv`) support an additional
parameter the conditions to be applied on the query. As example

```py
> conditions = ['parallax IS NOT NULL', 'parallax > 0', 'pmra IS NOT NULL', 'pmdec IS NOT NULL'] # uses ADQL
> newsample = dr3.get_astrometry(radius=1., gc='ngc104', conds=conditions)
"INFO: Query finished. [astroquery.utils.tap.core]"
"Sample number of sources: 131482"
```

We can see how the conditions were applied, excluding quite the number of sources.

While for these functions the data retrieved is fixed, there is the `.free_query` functions which, as
the name suggests, accepts bot the `data` and `conditions` additional arguments to customize the query.

### Data visualization
Let us work with the `a_smple` and the `newsample` from before. All the possible builtin visualization
functions of the `grasp` package, are within the `plots` module.

```py
> from grasp import plots as gplt # gplt -> grasp.plots
```

Just as (cool) examples, let's visualize the `parallax` distributions of the samples, as well as the
`proper motion` plots.

```py
> gplt.histogram(a_sample.parallax, xlabel='parallax', xlim=(-2,2))
```
![px1](./docs/pxdis_1_1.png)

With so many sources, the visualization is not great, so that limits have been applied. One coul even
perform analysis at the fly, like _Kerlen Density Estimation_ (here instead of putting limits to the
visualization only, the sample itself has been restricted, to gain resolution on the histogram bins)

```py
> gplt.histogram(
    a_sample.parallax[(a_sample.parallax > -2) & (a_sample.parallax < 2)], 
    kde=True, 
    kde_kind='gaussian', 
    xlabel='parallax'
  )
"Correctly imported `minpack.lm`."
```
![px2](./docs/pxdist_fit_normal.png)

And one could see that the distribution is better fitted by a lorentian distribution function
rather than a normal:

```py
> gplt.histogram(
    a_sample.parallax[(a_sample.parallax > -2) & (a_sample.parallax < 2)], 
    kde=True, 
    kde_kind='lorentzian', 
    xlabel='parallax'
  )
"Correctly imported `minpack.lm`."
```
![px3](./docs/pxdist_fit_lorentz.png)

Another example of visualization are the builtin `proper motion` plot and the `doubleHistScatter` plot:

```py
> conditions = {
...     'pmra':'>-50',
...     'pmra':'<50',
...     'pmdec':'<50',
...     'pmdec':'>-50'
}
> restricted_sample = newsample.apply_conditions(conditions)
> # here we are restricting the sample for visualization purposes and is equivalent to
> # restricted_sample = newsample[(newsample.pmra >-50) & (newsample.pmra < 50) & (newsample.pmdec >-50) & (newsample.pmdec < 50)]
> # with the only difference being that with the second method, a `QTable` is returned, while in the first
> # a `Sample` istance
> gplt.properMotion(restricted_sample)
```
![pm1](./docs/pmplot.png)

The `doubleHistScatter` plot is a scatter plot with projected distributions of the data in their axes
(with the `kde` option too)

```py
> gplt.doubleHistScatter(restricted_sample['pmra'], restricted_sample['pmdec'], ylabel='pmdec', xlabel='pmra', title='Proper Motion')
```
