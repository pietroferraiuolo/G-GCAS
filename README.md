## Packages Documentation

- [KING.F90] This Fortran program calculates the equilibrium configurations of a gravitational gas using the King distribution function as described in the 1966 article by I.P. King (King, I.P. (1966). AJ 71, 64.). The program is designed to analyze isotropic King models and can be modified to handle anisotropic Boltzmann functions.
